description: Assemble Flood tables, lists, cards and file records with long or changing data. Use for content hierarchy, overflow, row actions and data-state composition.

# Compose meaningful data structures

Use the installed component contracts and
[composition workflow](../flood-composition/SKILL.md). Start with the content's
relationships, not a wrapper around every piece of text.

- Table/DataTable preserve caption, headers, cell relationships and documented
  sorting/selection behavior. A footer represents a summary and should be
  visually distinguishable without relying on a heavy border everywhere.
- DescriptionList expresses named values; DataList/DataListItem express records.
  Card/Section/Surface organize groups without inventing a second typography or
  spacing system. A heading's semantic level does not prescribe its visual size.
- Keep row actions as named Flood Button/IconButton/Menu controls. Do not turn
  a whole row into a competing clickable wrapper around its nested actions.
- FileItem/FileMeta/UploadItem and their list owners compose file presentation;
  use their existing format/size/status/progress primitives. Selection, transport
  and preview are separate host operations. Do not manufacture upload completion.
- Preserve native image alt/fallback semantics and aspect constraints. Decorative
  artwork should not duplicate an adjacent accessible identity.

## Exercise data and geometry

Test no records, one record, long/wrapping names, absent optional media/actions,
loading, error/retry and selection/sorting where available. Keep error text useful
without inserting a second empty-state design or moving unrelated controls.
Align file title/metadata and status/progress by their intended row relationship;
do not hide a StatusIndicator dot or replace Progress with a custom track.

For an editable table, compare the centre of plain amounts and row actions with
the neighbouring input controls. Table's default top alignment is useful for
multiline records, but is not automatically correct for mixed control rows.
Use Table cellVerticalAlign="middle" for the relevant table when needed, without
moving text with transforms or overriding Input, NumberInput or Button internals.
Native style on an individual host-owned td/th can express an exceptional cell.
Do not depend on a low-specificity descendant CSS override. Check the rendered
centres; equal cell padding alone does not establish alignment.

Use the documented local overflow owner, with a meaningful accessible name. Focus
the last action/cell and check that a rail or rounded corner does not cover it.
Compare narrow/wide, enlarged text and RTL. Locale-sensitive text in prerendered
examples needs consistent server/client locale to avoid hydration differences.
