# @flood-md/react

Original React 18.3/19 components for TypeScript and Next.js App Router. Native
HTML semantics and refs, no third-party component library or Tailwind dependency.

This source documents the **0.2.0 release candidate**, not a verified npm
publication. The last verified public version is 0.1.1; use matching installed
documentation until the candidate is published.

```tsx
import "@flood-md/react/styles.css";
import { Button, FloodRoot, Heading, Stack, Text } from "@flood-md/react";

export function Welcome() {
  return (
    <FloodRoot>
      <Stack gap="4">
        <Heading level={1}>Welcome</Heading>
        <Text as="p" size="compact">Your workspace is ready.</Text>
        <Button>Open workspace</Button>
      </Stack>
    </FloodRoot>
  );
}
```

FloodRoot selects the neutral dark foundations profile: locally bundled Inter
with its original SIL OFL notice, semantic colors, relative typography/spacing,
radii, control sizes and state recipes. No new light foundations profile is
included. Legacy controls outside FloodRoot keep their earlier theme behavior.

Exports: FloodRoot, Text, Heading, Stack, Inline, Surface, Divider, IconSlot,
IconButton, Button, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Field and Link,
plus TypeScript prop types. Button variants are solid/subtle/outline/ghost;
sizes are 2xs/xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl. Prefer subtle for standalone secondary actions;
ghost belongs in a clear parent context. Loading disables activation.

Input/Textarea controlSize is sm/md/lg/xl; native Input size is preserved.
Field uses `{props => <Input {...props} />}`. Its required prop forwards native
required and displays a marker; describedBy merges external IDs with hint/error
associations. Checkbox/Radio/Switch require a visible label. IconSlot accepts
host SVG artwork without bundling an icon pack.

Import CSS once in Next app/layout.tsx. Add "use client" to host components
using state/callbacks or Field's function child. Override semantic --flood-sys-*
variables on the scope after the import. Surface overlay is visual elevation,
not dialog behavior. The focus accent remains configurable and provisional.

See [components](../../docs/components.md), [foundations](../../docs/foundations.md)
and [Inter provenance](src/fonts/README.md). Verify contrast, focus, keyboard,
narrow layouts and text scaling in your actual application.
